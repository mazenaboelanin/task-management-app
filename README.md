# TaskManagement

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.3.
By `Mazen Abo Elanin`

The Project allows you to:
  - Create and Manage your `Tasks` in a good way
  - Change the `state` of the task once you `started` or `finished` it.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm run server` for a running server side. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/tasks`. You will see the tasks json

## Future Features
- There will be some sort of filtration on the tasks like `filter_by_title`, `filter_by_date`, and so on.
- Tasks will be Categorized by state like `Todo`, `Inprogress`, and `Done`
